Tunnit is a worktime tracking application, with easy hour tracking and calendar for viewing the hours you've made.

You can use it to keep track of your work hours on your personal projects or create and join teams to share projects with your co-workers. You can also allocate hours for each member of the project to keep track on how well on schedule your team is staying and easily see how much time is used for each project.

Preview the app in action at [Time tracker in Heroku](https://tunnit.herokuapp.com/events)
